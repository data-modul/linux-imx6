Description
-----------

According to the iMX6 Reference Manual only two types of transactions
are supported by HDMI I2C Master Interface in Normal Mode:

A) one byte data write transaction (I2C spec write/write transmission):

   master   S|slave addr[6:0]|0|     |slave reg[7:0]|     |data[7:0]|     |P
   slave                       | ack |              | ack |         | ack |

B) one byte data read transaction (I2C spec write/read combined format):

   master   S|slave addr[6:0]|0|     |slave reg[7:0]|     | ...
   slave                       | ack |              | ack | ...

   master   ... Sr|slave addr[6:0]|1|     |         | ack |P
   slave    ...                     | Ack |data[7:0]|

HDMI I2C Master Interface Extended Read Mode allows to execute one
more transaction pattern so called segment pointer-based read:

C) segment pointer-based read (I2C spec write/write/read combined format):

   master   S|seg addr[6:0]|0|     |seg pointer[7:0]|     | ...
   slave                     | xxx |                | xxx | ...

   master   ... Sr|slave addr[6:0]|0|     |slave reg[7:0]|     | ...
   slave    ...                     | ack |              | ack | ...

   master   ... Sr|slave addr[6:0]|1|     |         | ack |P
   slave    ...                     | ack |data[7:0]|

At the moment Extended Read Mode is not supported by the driver.

The technical limitations of the iMX6 HDMI E-DDC bus does not allow
to call it an I2C compatible bus, however relativery large subset of
I2C transactions can be decomposed into aforementioned data read/write
operations and many I2C devices correctly support those operations,
but the primary goad of the device is to read EDID blob of a connected
HDMI monitor.


Notes
-----

The bus driver may be used independently on HDMI controller, but due
to device limitations it can not support arbitrary slave devices.
